### Hi there, I'm Artur! ðŸ‘‹

I recently finished two back-to-back batches at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed retreat for programmers in New York City. While at Recurse, I studied various web technologies centered around the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem such as React, TypeScript, and GraphQL. This culminated in the creation of [RC Projects](https://github.com/ArtSze/rc-prjkt). During the time since Recurse, I've built [Orbit](https://github.com/ArtSze/orbit).
